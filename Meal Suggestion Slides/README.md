# Recipe Recommendation
## Objectives
The purpose of our project is to recommend recipes to users based on their needs. Users can obtain our recommended recipes by entering information such as cuisine, course, time, ingredient, etc. on our website.

## Timeline and Management Plan
Our overall project will be progressed step by step in the following order:

First, in the "Topic selection" section, we carry out topic selection and data collection. Through discussion, we decided to make a shiny app that can recommend appropriate recipes to users according to their needs.

Next, we work on the "Description" part, including writing the project's ReadME and project proposal.

Then comes the main part of our project: Shiny app, Package and Website. In the Shiny app part, we are committed to designing and optimizing the structure of Shiny App, including algorithm design and performance optimization. In the Package section, we defined the overall structure of the R package, wrote functional code, generated documentation, and conducted comprehensive testing to ensure the quality and stability of the package. Finally, we focused on the Website part and created a website that is tightly integrated with the R package to provide users with convenient documentation, examples, and support. This concise and clear project structure will ensure that we advance in an orderly manner and provide users with a high-quality experience.

Finally, we used R to generate slides for our final presentation.

In terms of collaboration, we conducted a video meeting to finalize the project topic selection. Subsequent communication was predominantly carried out through our WhatsApp group, facilitating efficient and ongoing discussions.

## Data Description and Preparation
We Found the dataset from Kaggle, whcih contains more than 8000 food recipes with cuisines from across the globe (with major focus on Indian Dishes). In this dataset, we can get the information about the food recipes, approximate cooking and preparation times, cooking instructions,ingredients used, Recipe Author and Ratings. 

Then, to enhance the readability and analyzability of the dataset, preprocessing was performed. Initially, unnecessary columns were removed. Subsequently, certain columns underwent format conversion.
