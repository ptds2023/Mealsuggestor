Future Enhancements:

**Dynamic Data Integration:** Incorporating real-time data for more varied and updated meal suggestions.
**User Profiles:** Adding the ability to create user profiles for personalized suggestions and saved preferences.
**Simplified UI:** Improving user interface for enhanced ease of use and accessibility.
**Feedback System:** Implementing a user feedback system to refine and adapt meal suggestions.
