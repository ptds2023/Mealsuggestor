Future Enhancements:

- **Dynamic Data Integration:** Incorporating real-time data for more varied and updated meal suggestions.
- **User Profiles:** Adding the ability to create user profiles for personalized suggestions and saved preferences.
- **Add multiple:** Allow the user to add multiple ingrediants
- **Feedback System:** Implementing a user feedback system to refine and adapt meal suggestions.
